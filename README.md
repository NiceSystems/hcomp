hcomp
=====

a linux extenstion to allow tab auto completion for hadoop.

in order to activiate need to source the hcomp.sh file, preferably in .bashrc .

this allows the user to treat hadoop directories as linux directories  expension-wise.

to use the tab extention the  aliases attached in the file such as "hls" and "hcat" should be used instead of the full "hadoop fs -ls" or "hadoop fs -cat"

please note that the first time tab is pressed response might be slow but should be significntly faster after that
